# $Christofer's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line. I worked on creating folders and text and moving in and out of folders using the 'cd' command. At first I had difficulty knowing where I was in the command line, but after making numerious steps back and then going into folders using commands and using the 'ls' to list the objects inside I was able to navigate much better. The 'nypl' folder and tutorial was very useful as well, for finding specific items in large amounts of text.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book 
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Emailed classmates to get up to date with what I missed first class
Hour 4: Worked on simple commands like 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'mkdir'
Hour 5: Opened cheatsheet text in VSCode and edited it 
Hour 6: Worked on first weeks tutorial - nypl folder and text
Hour 7: Originally thought I would never be able to complete the first weeks tutorial but was able to with confidence, after a couple tries.


## Week Three (2/6 to 2/13)

After the excitement from last weeks class, I was very excited to play around with the command line and VSCode to cement tasks I was warming up to from the previous week. After reviewing some of the techniques from last weeks class I started to play around with Python, but was not able to get too far. Some of the uses of the command line in bash can also be used in anaconda and spent time playing around with what could possibly be donw in the other and what can't be done.

Hour 1: Reviewed class notes and conitnued to review going in and out of the command line and folders on my desktop
Hour 2: Continued to review
Hour 3: Continued to review and edited documents in VSCode
Hour 4: Downloaded software for class and started working with Python and Anaconda
Hour 5: Continued to work on understanding new software
Hour 6: Watched videos and read other sources on python
Hour 7: Reviewed material for class and worked on anaconda


## Week four (2/13 to 2/20)

This week, after the exitement from last weeks class, I started to put together a prompt that I wanted to play with. However, when I was cleaning up my folders on my desktop I X'd out of my anaconda script and lost all my work from class that I was planning to slowly go over again to create a new prompt. Luckily, a classmate pointed me in the right direction to go over class instruction. Basically forgot to go in and out of python and how to run a prompt. I have relearned what we were working on and am enjoying working in Python! 

Hour 1: Python review from last class
Hour 2: Created a simple python input code for emotions
