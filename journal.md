Christofer's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line. I worked on creating folders and text and moving in and out of folders using the 'cd' command. At first I had difficulty knowing where I was in the command line, but after making numerious steps back and then going into folders using commands and using the 'ls' to list the objects inside I was able to navigate much better. The 'nypl' folder and tutorial was very useful as well, for finding specific items in large amounts of text.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book 
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Emailed classmates to get up to date with what I missed first class
Hour 4: Worked on simple commands like 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'mkdir'
Hour 5: Opened cheatsheet text in VSCode and edited it 
Hour 6: Worked on first weeks tutorial - nypl folder and text
Hour 7: Originally thought I would never be able to complete the first weeks tutorial but was able to with confidence, after a couple tries.


## Week Three (2/6 to 2/13)

After the excitement from last weeks class, I was very excited to play around with the command line and VSCode to cement tasks I was warming up to from the previous week. After reviewing some of the techniques from last weeks class I started to play around with Python, but was not able to get too far. Some of the uses of the command line in bash can also be used in anaconda and spent time playing around with what could possibly be donw in the other and what can't be done.

Hour 1: Reviewed class notes and conitnued to review going in and out of the command line and folders on my desktop
Hour 2: Continued to review
Hour 3: Continued to review and edited documents in VSCode
Hour 4: Downloaded software for class and started working with Python and Anaconda
Hour 5: Continued to work on understanding new software
Hour 6: Watched videos and read other sources on python
Hour 7: Reviewed material for class and worked on anaconda


## Week four (2/13 to 2/20)

This week, after the exitement from last weeks class, I started to put together a prompt that I wanted to play with. However, when I was cleaning up my folders on my desktop I X'd out of my anaconda script and lost all my work from class that I was planning to slowly go over again to create a new prompt. Luckily, a classmate pointed me in the right direction to go over class instruction. Basically forgot to go in and out of python and how to run a prompt. I have relearned what we were working on and am enjoying working in Python! 

Hour 1: Python review from last class
Hour 2: Created a simple python input code for emotions
Hour 3: Created a simple python import random code for facts
Hour 4: Started Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Hour 5: Continued Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Hour 6: Continued Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Hour 7: Went over materials to be discussed in class

This week, I reworked the sloth emporium html page for my own website. I created a front/home page, CV page, Bio page, and Portfolio page that all link together. Worked on formating HTML page and looked at similar professional pages to create a similar and professional page. Still need to add verbage, but like how the page is starting to come together.

## Week four (2/27 to 3/6)

This week I worked on "Learn Python the Hard Way" with a fellow classmate. We went through the first 4 steps for Python 3 and updated the command line to function with multiple platforms. After getting sucked into the "Free as in Freedom" reading, I decided to focus on the life and work of Richard Stallman. Sam Williams did a terrific job of not only informing the reader about Stallman, but did so in a way that I thought was very lite and almost funny. I had a lot of the feels go through me while reading. A wonderful read! 

Hour 1: Worked on exercises 1-4 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Hour 2: Read "Free as in Freedom"
Hour 3: Read "Free as in Freedom"
Hour 4: Read "Free as in Freedom"
Hour 5: Read "Free as in Freedom"
Hour 6: Read "Free as in Freedom"
Hour 7: Read "Free as in Freedom"


## Week four (3/6 to 3/13)

This week, since I wasn't able to do as much coding as I would have liked, I continued to work on "Learn Python the Hard Way". I was getting into a rythm, but lessons 13, 14, and 15 threw me through a loop with the use of arguments. It took me a nearly two hours to get the hang of it, but after go back and forth through the lessons I was able to gain a better grasp. 

Hour 1: Worked on excercises 4-6 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Hour 2: Worked on excercises 7-9 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Hour 3: Worked on excercises 10-12 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Hour 4: Worked on excercises 13-14 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Hour 5: Worked on excercises 14-15 in "Learn Python the Hard Way"


## Week four (3/13 to 3/20)

Attended a two hour workshop on Graphic Design for Websites. The workshop was lead by Ryan Seslow and he showed us his website and some of the projects he has been working on. Although I thought we were going to work on a website of our own, it was informing to have Ryan go through his website and have him tell us what important movements have taken place in regards to fonts and layout in the last decade.
