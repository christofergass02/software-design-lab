Christofer's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line. I worked on creating folders and text and moving in and out of folders using the 'cd' command. At first I had difficulty knowing where I was in the command line, but after making numerious steps back and then going into folders using commands and using the 'ls' to list the objects inside I was able to navigate much better. The 'nypl' folder and tutorial was very useful as well, for finding specific items in large amounts of text.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book 
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Emailed classmates to get up to date with what I missed first class

Hour 7: Originally thought I would never be able to complete the first weeks tutorial but was able to with confidence, after a couple tries.


## Week Three (2/6 to 2/13)

After the excitement from last weeks class, I was very excited to play around with the command line and VSCode to cement tasks I was warming up to from the previous week. After reviewing some of the techniques from last weeks class I started to play around with Python, but was not able to get too far. Some of the uses of the command line in bash can also be used in anaconda and spent time playing around with what could possibly be donw in the other and what can't be done.

Hour 1: Reviewed class notes and conitnued to review going in and out of the command line and folders on my desktop

## Week four (2/13 to 2/20)

This week, after the exitement from last weeks class, I started to put together a prompt that I wanted to play with. However, when I was cleaning up my folders on my desktop I X'd out of my anaconda script and lost all my work from class that I was planning to slowly go over again to create a new prompt. Luckily, a classmate pointed me in the right direction to go over class instruction. Basically forgot to go in and out of python and how to run a prompt. I have relearned what we were working on and am enjoying working in Python!

This week I worked on "Learn Python the Hard Way" with a fellow classmate. We went through the first 4 steps for Python 3 and updated the command line to function with multiple platforms. After getting sucked into the "Free as in Freedom" reading, I decided to focus on the life and work of Richard Stallman. Sam Williams did a terrific job of not only informing the reader about Stallman, but did so in a way that I thought was very lite and almost funny. I had a lot of the feels go through me while reading. A wonderful read!

## Week seven (3/6 to 3/13)

This week, since I wasn't able to do as much coding as I would have liked, I continued to work on "Learn Python the Hard Way". I was getting into a rythm, but lessons 13, 14, and 15 threw me through a loop with the use of arguments. It took me a nearly two hours to get the hang of it, but after go back and forth through the lessons I was able to gain a better grasp.

## Week eight (3/13 to 3/20)

Attended a two hour workshop on Graphic Design for Websites. The workshop was lead by Ryan Seslow and he showed us his website and some of the projects he has been working on. Although I thought we were going to work on a website of our own, it was informing to have Ryan go through his website and have him tell us what important movements have taken place in regards to fonts and layout in the last decade. I am also still conquering "Learn Python the Hard Way" as well.

## Week ten (3/27 to 4/3)

This week I have been focused on the application Sabina and I are creating for Thomas. The application is a Oral History App and I first started by drawing out how I conceived the app to look. This process was showcased from our presenters and was exceptionally helpful to me for visualizing something I am not sure how to create. Other aspects of there discussion that have weighed heavily on me, in a very positive way, was there uncertainty to clarity graph and MSCW technique. My meeting with Sabina was exceptionally fruitful. Her MVP is different than mine, so we discussed and debated what was essential for the MVP - an ongoing conversation. We are very invested in this. Following our meeting I created additional pages and linked them to the site.

Met with Sabina at City College and worked on Oral History App. We started our wireframe, but decided to put it to the side to focus on recreating our app in Flask. After our meeting I worked a few hours on creating a wireframe in Invision. Created the first two pages, the 'Home' and 'Add' page and sent to Sabina for her thoughts. Overall, she liked how it looked, but just had a couple small changes.

## Week fourteen (4/24 to 5/1)

Have been meeting with Sabina to create the Oral History Application. We have meeting in many different places to work on this app, but the most fruitfull experience was at the NYPL on 42nd. It is a place strictly conducive to learning and for us, the creation of this app. Major impactful moments from our meeting at the library was the creation of the 'Add' page for the app and a sqlite database. However, after making wonderful headway in the early hours of our meeting, we hit a brick wall and trudged through the last half of our meeting in hopes of creating further headway. However, the damage was done and we cut our loses and plan to meet again in two days. 

We met at NYPL for two hours before moving to the library at the Grad Center. Disappointment is starting to surface. I have been wasting so much time initially attempting to go around 'pip install' and now trying to install pip. Running into issue after issue. One route I have been told to go through using https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation is to create a new 'System Variable' in 'Environmental Variables', but when I open 'Environmental Variables' the 'New', 'Edit', and 'Delete' tabs are not clickable . . . just stuff like that one after another. Keeping me from focusing on the app itself, but we'll get through this. Hoping to have fixed before Sabina and I meet with the Digital Fellows tomorrow at 3, if not I will have to work it out with them, but again, that would unfortunately take away from working on the app. Again, we will overcome!

Met with the Digital Fellows with Sabina for their 3-5 office hours. Was able to work with Kristen on the issue I have been having. Although we were not able to find a clear cut answer for what I am trying to do we went through steps to try to run pip and install virtualenvironment. The last thing we attempted was uninstalling Python, which was kind of scary for me. I know Python works, I've been using it, but Kristen brought up that I might have not checked for adding to PATH. Although I remember going through the tutorial step by step, she might be right. So I uninstalled and then reinstalled. I hope that fixes the issue. Wow, I installed improperly. What a waste of time on my part.

## Week fifteen (5/1 to 5/8)

Met with Thomas after class to show him our progress. He also gave us a page to use as a template for creating an instruction manual for showing future admin how get the site working and to utilize the site. Met with Sabina at the GC to work on coding for the app.

Continued to work through Miguel's tutorial and then Skyped with Thomas. Conversation went well. We informed and showed Thomas where we are and he directed us to focus on style and jasonifying the form page to collection page. I have taken on the styling aspect, while Sabina is going to work on jasonifying the form output. We hope to be able to show Thomas a working site by Wednesday, but it not be until next Sunday, maybe. 

Added an image to the front page of our app that Sabina took of her local hardware store - Kove Bros Hardware. While she creates a fictional database for the owner and employees to add as a temporary filler. With hopes of having this information jsonified. Working on styling the site, but having issues with my stylesheet connecting with the app. Have tried multiple different CSS files and different ways of writing in my html file, but nothing seems to work, yet.

## Week sixteen (5/8 to 5/15)

Sabina and I are at it again. We have spent so many hours on this app, but I feel like we do not have much to show for it, unfortunately. Sabina is woking to recreate site, 2.0, with a focus on databases. I am working on styling and creating links to other pages from within Collections page. Changed the size of the image on the front page. Sounds like a simple task, but after the difficulty we've been having a small win feels good. Working abroad on this Mother's Day. Still working to add a static site. Once I do that I plan to add some style. Having technical difficulties. My computer is not been cooperating too well. Just want to last for a couple more weeks, until the end of semester and all my work is done. Sabina went in a different direction with the app and it has a new look and process. We will go with this and write instructions that will be deposited with the code to Github, then white paper. The semester has been a blast!
